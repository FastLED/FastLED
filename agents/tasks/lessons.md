# Lessons Learned

<!-- Add lessons from corrections and discoveries here -->

- Inspect the actual WASM compiler manifest before assuming an npm dependency: it
  currently pins the `@fastled/gfx` GitHub Release tarball by exact URL.

- For the current HydroPack prototype, prioritize a readable ordinary-LED
  approximation of the < | > layout over further EL-shape fidelity.

- HydroPack's two sensitivity levels are visual layers, not separate status
  dots: use the sensitive analyzer for the center and the loud analyzer for
  the triangles so strong bass appears to launch outward.
