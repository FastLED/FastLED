// Repro for GitHub issue #2193 comment 4019752955:
// VibeDetector mid/treble relative levels stuck at 1.00
//
// The bug: For continuous signals (mid/treble in real music), the EMA-based
// normalization chain (mImm → mAvg → mLongAvg) converges, so
// mImm / mLongAvg ≈ 1.0 at all times. Bass works because it has impulsive
// content (spikes followed by silence), creating divergence between
// immediate and long-term averages.
