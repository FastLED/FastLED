# Intermediate Techniques

**Difficulty Level**: ⭐⭐ Intermediate
**Time to Complete**: 2-3 hours (to read and work through all four intermediate technique documents)
**Prerequisites**: [Getting Started](../getting-started/), [Core Concepts](../core-concepts/), [Basic Patterns](../basic-patterns/)

**You'll Learn**:
- How to use color palettes for sophisticated color schemes and smooth transitions
- How to create organic, natural-looking animations with noise functions
- Techniques for blending colors and transitioning smoothly between patterns
- Mathematical utilities for creating rhythmic, precise, and complex animations

---

This section covers intermediate FastLED techniques that go beyond basic patterns and animations. These techniques will help you create more sophisticated and professional-looking LED effects.

## Topics Covered

### [Color Palettes](palettes.md)
Learn how to use predefined and custom color palettes to create smooth color transitions and sophisticated effects. Color palettes allow you to define a set of colors and smoothly blend between them.

### [Noise and Perlin Noise](noise.md)
Discover how to use FastLED's noise functions to create organic, natural-looking animations. Noise functions are perfect for effects like lava lamps, clouds, and other flowing patterns.

### [Blending and Transitions](blending.md)
Master the art of smooth color blending and transitions between patterns. Learn techniques for creating trails, fading effects, and cross-fading between different animations.

### [Math and Mapping Functions](math.md)
Explore FastLED's mathematical utilities including scaling, wave functions, easing, and beat generators. These functions are essential for creating rhythmic and mathematically precise animations.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into these intermediate techniques, you should be familiar with:
- Basic FastLED setup and configuration
- LED data structures (CRGB arrays)
- RGB and HSV color models
- Simple animation patterns
- The main loop structure

If you need a refresher on these basics, check out the [Getting Started](../getting-started/) section.

## What's Next?

After mastering these intermediate techniques, you'll be ready to tackle:
- 2D/Matrix operations
- Audio reactive patterns
- Multiple strip coordination
- Performance optimization

These advanced topics are covered in the [Advanced Effects](../advanced/) section.
