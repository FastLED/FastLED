**Difficulty Level**: ⭐⭐ Beginner to Intermediate
**Time to Complete**: 1-2 hours (to read and understand all core concepts)
**Prerequisites**: [Getting Started](../getting-started/) - Complete the getting-started section first

**You'll Learn**:
- How LED arrays store and organize color data in memory
- When to use RGB vs HSV color models for different effects
- How to control animation timing and frame rates for smooth effects
- How to calculate and manage power requirements for your LED projects

- [Power Considerations](power.md) - Manage power consumption

## Overview

This section covers the essential concepts you need to understand to create effective LED animations. Start with LED data structures to understand how colors are stored and manipulated, then learn about color theory to work with different color models efficiently.

Timing and frame rate control are crucial for smooth animations, and power management ensures your projects run safely and reliably.
