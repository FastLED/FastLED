// Use this option only for debugging pin access and forcing software pin access.  Note that
// software pin access only works in Arduino based environments.  Forces use of digitalWrite
// methods for pin access vs. direct hardware port access
// #define FASTLED_FORCE_SOFTWARE_PINS

// Use this option only for debugging bitbang'd spi access or to work around bugs in hardware
// spi access.  Forces use of bit-banged spi, even on pins that has hardware SPI available.
// #define FASTLED_FORCE_SOFTWARE_SPI

// Use this to force FastLED to allow interrupts in the clockless chipsets (or to force it to
// disallow), overriding the default on platforms that support this.  Set the value to 1 to
// allow interrupts or 0 to disallow them.
// #define FASTLED_ALLOW_INTERRUPTS 1
// #define FASTLED_ALLOW_INTERRUPTS 0

// Use this to allow some integer overflows/underflows in the inoise functions.
// The original implementions allowed this, and had some discontinuties in the noise
// output.  It's technically an implementation bug, and was fixed, but you may wish
// to preserve the old look and feel of the inoise functions in your existing animations.
// The default is 0:  NO overflow, and 'continuous' noise output, aka the fixed way.
// #define FASTLED_NOISE_ALLOW_AVERAGE_TO_OVERFLOW 0
// #define FASTLED_NOISE_ALLOW_AVERAGE_TO_OVERFLOW 1

// Use this toggle whether or not to use the 'fixed' FastLED scale8.  The initial scale8
// had a problem where scale8(255,255) would give you 254.  This is now fixed, and that
// fix is enabled by default.  However, if for some reason you have code that is not
// working right as a result of this (e.g. code that was expecting the old scale8 behavior)
// you can disable it here.
#define FASTLED_SCALE8_FIXED 1
// #define FASTLED_SCALE8_FIXED 0

// Use this toggle whether to use 'fixed' FastLED pixel blending, including ColorFromPalette.
// The prior pixel blend functions had integer-rounding math errors that led to
// small errors being inadvertently added to the low bits of blended colors, including colors
// retrieved from color palettes using LINEAR_BLEND.  This is now fixed, and the
// fix is enabled by default.  However, if for some reason you wish to run with the old
// blending, including the integer rounding and color errors, you can disable the bugfix here.
#define FASTLED_BLEND_FIXED 1
// #define FASTLED_BLEND_FIXED 0

// Use this toggle whether to use 'fixed' FastLED 8- and 16-bit noise functions.
// The prior noise functions had some math errors that led to 'discontinuities' in the
// output, which by definition should be smooth and continuous.  The bug led to 
// noise function output that had 'edges' and glitches in it.  This is now fixed, and the
// fix is enabled by default.  However, if for some reason you wish to run with the old
// noise code, including the glitches, you can disable the bugfix here.
#define FASTLED_NOISE_FIXED 1
//#define FASTLED_NOISE_FIXED 0

// Use this to determine how many times FastLED will attempt to re-transmit a frame if interrupted
// for too long by interrupts.
