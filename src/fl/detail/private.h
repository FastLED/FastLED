// IWYU pragma: private

// Sentinel header for IWYU mappings. Do not include directly.
// This exists so private headers can map to something that IWYU
// will never recommend. Since this header is itself marked private
// with no public replacement, IWYU will silently suppress the
// suggestion rather than recommending a wrong header.
