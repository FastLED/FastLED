 * I2S Driver
 *
 * Copyright (c) 2019 Yves Bazin
 * Copyright (c) 2019 Samuel Z. Guyer
 * Derived from lots of code examples from other people.
 *
 * The I2S implementation can drive up to 24 strips in parallel, but
 * with the following limitation: all the strips must have the same
 * timing (i.e., they must all use the same chip).
 *
 * To enable the I2S driver, add the following line *before* including
 * FastLED.h (no other changes are necessary):
 *
 * #define FASTLED_ESP32_I2S true
 *
 * The overall strategy is to use the parallel mode of the I2S "audio"
 * peripheral to send up to 24 bits in parallel to 24 different pins.
 * Unlike the RMT peripheral the I2S system cannot send bits of
 * different lengths. Instead, we set the I2S data clock fairly high
 * and then encode a signal as a series of bits. 
 *
 * For example, with a clock divider of 10 the data clock will be
 * 8MHz, so each bit is 125ns. The WS2812 expects a "1" bit to be
 * encoded as a HIGH signal for around 875ns, followed by LOW for
 * 375ns. Sending the following pattern results in the right shape
 * signal:
 *
 *    1111111000        WS2812 "1" bit encoded as 10 125ns pulses
 *
 * The I2S peripheral expects the bits for all 24 outputs to be packed
 * into a single 32-bit word. The complete signal is a series of these
 * 32-bit values -- one for each bit for each strip. The pixel data,
 * however, is stored "serially" as a series of RGB values separately
 * for each strip. To prepare the data we need to do three things: (1)
 * take 1 pixel from each strip, and (2) tranpose the bits so that
 * they are in the parallel form, (3) translate each data bit into the
 * bit pattern that encodes the signal for that bit. This code is in
 * the fillBuffer() method:
 *
 *   1. Read 1 pixel from each strip into an array; store this data by
 *      color channel (e.g., all the red bytes, then all the green
 *      bytes, then all the blue bytes). For three color channels, the
 *      array is 3 X 24 X 8 bits.
 *
 *   2. Tranpose the array so that it is 3 X 8 X 24 bits. The hardware
 *      wants the data in 32-bit chunks, so the actual form is 3 X 8 X
 *      32, with the low 8 bits unused.
 *
 *   3. Take each group of 24 parallel bits and "expand" them into a
 *      pattern according to the encoding. For example, with a 8MHz
 *      data clock, each data bit turns into 10 I2s pulses, so 24
 *      parallel data bits turn into 10 X 24 pulses.
 *
 * We send data to the I2S peripheral using the DMA interface. We use
 * two DMA buffers, so that we can fill one buffer while the other
 * buffer is being sent. Each DMA buffer holds the fully-expanded
 * pulse pattern for one pixel on up to 24 strips. The exact amount of
 * memory required depends on the number of color channels and the
 * number of pulses used to encode each bit.
 *
 * We get an interrupt each time a buffer is sent; we then fill that
 * buffer while the next one is being sent. The DMA interface allows
 * us to configure the buffers as a circularly linked list, so that it
 * can automatically start on the next buffer.
 */
/*
 * The implementation uses two DMA buffers by default. To increase the 
 * number of DMA buffers set the preprocessor definition 
 * 
 * FASTLED_ESP32_I2S_NUM_DMA_BUFFERS 
 *
 * to a value between 2 and 16. Increasing the buffer to 4 by adding
 *
 * #define FASTLED_ESP32_I2S_NUM_DMA_BUFFERS 4 
 *
 * solves flicker issues in combination with interrupts triggered by 
 * other code parts.
