# Overview of this docker file
# This is a emscripten docker file that is used to compile FastLED for the web assembly platform.
# The goals of this docker are:
#   * Compile the inputs as quickly as possible.
#   * Be very fast to rebuild
# Container size is important, but not the primary goal.
#
# The emscripten build is based on emscripten. We create a custom `wasm_compiler_flags.py``
# that performs the necessary transformations to make this work.
#
# Maximizing compiler speed
# First let's talk about why platformio is typically slow
#   * Network checking to see if the repo's are up to date
#   * Unnecessary recompilation of cpp files that haven't changed.
#
# We address these slow compiler speeds via a few tricks
#   * The emscripten compiler is wrapped in ccache so that identical compilations are cached.
#   * We prewarm the ccache with a pre-compile of an example
#     * This will generate the initial cache and also install the necessary tools.
#
# Pre-warming the cache
#   * We have two pre-warm cycles. We do this for speed reasons.
#     * The first pre-warm is done with a copy of fastled downloaded from the github repo
#       * Docker is very relaxed on invalidating a cache layer for statements cloning a github repo. We want this.
#       * So we clone the repo early in the docker image build cycle. Then we run a pre-warm compile.
#         * This is the slowest pre-warm, and once built, tends to always be cached. However, it tends to go out of date
#           quickly, which will make the cache be less effective.
#   * The second pre-warm is done with a fresh copy of the fastled repo from the host machine that is copied over the
#     git hub repo. We copy directories piece by piece to maximize the cache hit rate. Core files then platform files.
#     * During developement when many files are changed, this second pre-warm will almost always be invalidated, however
#       it is very fast to rebuild because the initial tool download of platformio has already been done with the first pre-warm.
#     * After this second pre-warm, the ccache will have the exact state of the repo in it's cache.
#
# Final state
#  * The final state of the docker image is a pre-warmed cached with the entire instance ready to compile.
#  * The calling code is expected to provide volume mapped directory that will be inserted into the docker image when it runs.
#  * However, this is not true when using this in server mode (see server.py) where the code to be compiled is injected into the
#    container instance via a FastAPI route, the compilation is performed. Typically the web compiler is much better at holding
#    on the cached files. Server.py will also periodically git pull the fastled repo to keep in sync with the latest changes.
