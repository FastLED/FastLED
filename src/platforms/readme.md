### Controller types in FastLED

FastLED provides two primary controller categories. Choose based on your LED chipset and platform capabilities.

#### 1) Clockless (one‑wire NRZ)

- For WS2811/WS2812/WS2812B/SK6812 and similar “NeoPixel”‑class LEDs
- Encodes bits as precisely timed high/low pulses (T0H/T1H/T0L/T1L)
- Implemented with tight CPU timing loops, SysTick, or hardware assist (e.g., [ESP32 RMT or I2S‑parallel](./esp/32/README.md))
- Available as single‑lane and, on some platforms, multi‑lane “block clockless” drivers
- Sensitive to long interrupts; keep ISRs short during `show()`

Special cases:
- ESP32 offers multiple backends for clockless output (see [esp/32](./esp/32/README.md)):
  - RMT (recommended, per‑channel timing)
  - I2S‑parallel (many strips with identical timing)
  - Clockless over SPI (WS2812‑class only)

#### 2) SPI (clocked)

- For chipsets with data+clock lines (APA102/DotStar, SK9822, LPD8806, WS2801)
- Uses hardware SPI peripherals to shift pixels with explicit clocking
- Generally tolerant of interrupts and scales to higher data rates more easily
- Requires an SPI‑capable LED chipset (not for WS2812‑class, except the ESP32 “clockless over SPI” path above)

### Picking the right path

- WS2812/SK6812 → Clockless controllers (ESP32: RMT or I2S‑parallel for many identical strips)
- APA102/SK9822/DotStar → SPI controllers for stability and speed
- Prefer [neopixelbus](./neopixelbus/README.md) or [adafruit](./adafruit/README.md) adapters if you rely on those ecosystems but want to keep FastLED’s API
 esp/32 I2S docs
```

RP2040 (PIO clockless) needs no special defines; use standard WS2812 addLeds call.

### Backend selection cheat sheet

- [ESP32](./esp/32/README.md) clockless: RMT (flexible), I2S‑parallel (many identical strips), or SPI‑WS2812 path (WS2812‑only)
- Teensy 3.x/4.x: clockless (single or block multi‑lane), plus OctoWS2811/SmartMatrix integrations (see [arm/k20](./arm/k20/README.md), [arm/mxrt1062](./arm/mxrt1062/README.md))
- [AVR](./avr/README.md): clockless WS2812 and SPI chipsets; small devices benefit from fewer interrupts during `show()`

### Troubleshooting and tips

- First‑pixel flicker or color glitches often indicate interrupt interference. Reduce background ISRs (Wi‑Fi/BLE/logging) during `FastLED.show()` or select a hardware‑assisted backend.
- Power and level shifting matter: WS281x typically need 5V data at sufficient current; ensure a common ground between controller and LEDs.
- On ARM families, PROGMEM is typically disabled (`FASTLED_USE_PROGMEM=0`); on AVR it is enabled.
- For very large installations, consider parallel outputs (OctoWS2811 on Teensy, I2S‑parallel on ESP32) and DMA‑friendly patterns.

### Notes on configuration defines

- Each platform README includes an "Optional feature defines" section with the macros you can override in your sketch. If a platform folder lacks a README, see its `led_sysdefs_*.h`, `fastpin_*.h`, and controller headers for documented defaults.
