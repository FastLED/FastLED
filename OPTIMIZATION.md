### 2. **üö® NEW PRIMARY BOTTLENECK: FastLED Library Compilation**
- **Impact**: 34% of total build time (6.60s out of 19.34s)
- **Root Cause**: Unity build compiles 130 FastLED .cpp files into static library every time
- **Status**: IDENTIFIED - needs optimization

### 3. **Linking Process Overhead**
- **Impact**: 88.4% of clean build time

### B. **üö® HIGH PRIORITY: FastLED Library Build Optimization**
**Impact: VERY HIGH (potential 30-50% of clean build time)**
- **Root Cause**: Building 130 FastLED .cpp files takes 6.60s (34% of total)
- **Solutions**:
  - Implement FastLED library caching (check if library needs rebuild)
