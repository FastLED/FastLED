FastLED 3.7.8
=============
* Attiny0/1 (commonly Attiny85) support added.
  * https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/pull/1292 , https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/pull/1183 , https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/pull/1061
  * Special thanks to [@freemovers](https://github.com/freemovers), [@jasoncoon](https://github.com/jasoncoon), [@ngyl88](https://github.com/ngyl88) for the contribution.
  * Many common boards are now compiling in the Attiny family. See our repo for which ones are supported.
* Arduino nano compiling with new pin definitions.
  *  https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/pull/1719
  *  Thanks to https://github.com/ngyl88 for the contribution!
* New STM32F1 boards compiling
  * bluepill
  * maple mini
* CPPCheck now passing for HIGH and MEDIUM severity on all platforms.


FastLED 3.7.7
=============
* WS2812 RGBW mode is now part of the API.
  * Api: `FastLED.addLeds<WS2812, DATA_PIN, GRB>(leds, NUM_LEDS).setRgbw(RgbwDefault());`
  * Only enabled on ESP32 boards, no op on other platforms.
  * See [examples/RGBW/RGBW.ino](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/blob/master/examples/RGBW/RGBW.ino)
* WS2812 Emulated RGBW Controller
  * Works on all platforms (theoretically)
  * Has an extra side buffer to convert RGB -> RGBW data.
    * This data is sent to the real driver as if it were RGB data.
    * Some padding is added when source LED data is not a multiple of 3.
  * See [examples/RGBWEmulated/RGBWEmulated.ino](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/blob/master/examples/RGBW/RGBW.ino)
* New supported chipsets
  * UCS1912 (Clockless)
  * WS2815 (Clockless)
* New supported boards
  * xiaoblesense_adafruit
    * Fixes https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/issues/1445
* [PixelIterator](src/pixel_iterator.h) has been introduced to reduce complexity of writing driver code
  * This is how RGBW mode was implemented.
  * This is a concrete class (no templates!) so it's suitable for driver code in cpp files.
  * PixelController<> can convert to a PixelIterator, see `PixelController<>::as_iterator(...)`
* Fixed APA102HD mode for user supplied function via the linker. Added test so that it won't break.


FastLED 3.7.6
=============
* WS2812 RGBW Mode enabled on ESP32 via experimental `FASTLED_EXPERIMENTAL_ESP32_RGBW_ENABLED`
* RPXXXX compiler fixes to solve asm segment overflow violation
* ESP32 binary size blew up in 3.7.5, in 3.7.6 it's back to the same size as 3.7.4
* APA102 & SK9822 have downgraded their default clock speed to improve "just works" experience
  * APA102 chipsets have downgraded their default clock from 24 mhz to 6mhz to get around "long strip signal degredaton bug"
    * https://www.pjrc.com/why-apa102-leds-have-trouble-at-24-mhz/
    * We are prioritizing "just works by default" rather than "optimized by default but only for short strips".
    * 6 Mhz is still blazingly fast compared to WS2812 and you can always bump it up to get more performance.
  * SK9822 have downgraded their default clock from 24 mhz -> 12 mhz out of an abundance of caution.
    * I don't see an analysis of whether SK9822 has the same issue as the APA102 for the clock signal degredation.
    * However, 12 mhz is still blazingly fast (>10x) compared to WS2812. If you need faster, bump it up.
* NRF52XXX platforms
  * Selecting an invalid pin will not spew pages and pages of template errors. Now it's been deprecated to a runtime message and assert.
* nrf52840 compile support now official.

FastLED 3.7.1
=============
This is a bug fix release
  * https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/commit/85650d9eda459df20ea966b85d48b84053c2c604
    * Addresses compiler issues related ESP32-S3 and the RMT legacy driver in ArduinoIDE 2.3.2 update which now includes the ESP-IDF 5.1.
    * Note that this is a compiler fix *only* and was simple. If the community reports additional problems we will release a bugfix to address it.
  * https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/commit/e0a34180c5ad1512aa39f6b6c0987119535d39e8
    * Work around for ESP32 halt when writing WS2812 LEDS under massive load. It appears there was an underflow condition in a critical ISR to refill the RMT buffer that did not give back to a semaphore. Subsequent calls to `show()` would then block forever. We now given a max timeout so that in the worse case scenario there will be a momentary hang of `portMAX_DELAY`.
