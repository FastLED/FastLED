## Daniel Garcia, Founder of FastLED

In Memory of Daniel Garcia
Daniel Garcia, the brilliant founder of FastLED, tragically passed away in September 2019 in the Conception dive boat fire alongside his partner, Yulia. This heartbreaking loss was felt deeply by the maker and developer community, where Daniel's contributions had left an indelible mark.

Daniel was more than just a talented programmer; he was a passionate innovator who transformed the way creators interacted with LED technology. His work on FastLED brought high-performance LED control to countless projects, empowering developers to craft breathtaking installations.

In his personal life, Daniel was known for his kindness and creativity. His pride in FastLED and the vibrant community it fostered was a testament to his dedication to open-source development and his commitment to helping others bring light into the world.

While Daniel is no longer with us, his legacy continues through the FastLED library and the countless makers who use it. The community he built serves as a living tribute to his ingenuity, generosity, and the joy he found in sharing his work with the world.

## About the Current Contributor

Zach Vorhies, the current main contributor to FastLED, briefly worked with Dan in 2014 in San Francisco and was an avid user of the FastLED library for over 13 years. After Daniel Garcia’s untimely passing, Zach stepped up to ensure FastLED’s continued growth and development.

Zach has this to say about FastLED:

*"The true power of FastLED lies in its ability to transform programmers into LED artists. Free space becomes their canvas; bending light is their medium. FastLED is a collective effort by programmers who want to manifest the world that science fiction writers promised us. -- To contribute code to FastLED is to leave behind a piece of something immortal."*
